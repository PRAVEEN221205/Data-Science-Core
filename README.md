# Data-Science-Core

This repository contains the foundational concepts and practical implementations required for Data Analytics and Machine Learning.

The goal of this repository is to build a strong understanding of:

- Numerical Computing (NumPy)
- Data Manipulation (Pandas)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Core Machine Learning Fundamentals

All implementations are done using Python with a focus on clarity, structure, and practical understanding.
