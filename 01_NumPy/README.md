# NumPy

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a core Python library used for numerical and scientific computing.  
It provides high-performance multidimensional arrays and mathematical tools required for Data Analytics and Machine Learning.

## NumPy Array vs Python List

| Feature | NumPy Array | Python List |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Data Type | Homogeneous (same type only) | Heterogeneous (different types allowed) |
| Speed | Very fast (C-level implementation) | Slower |
| Vector Operations | Direct element-wise operations | Requires loops |
| Memory Efficiency | High | Lower |

## Key Features

### 1. N-Dimensional Arrays (`ndarray`)

NumPy provides a powerful array structure:

- 1D Arrays (Vectors)  
- 2D Arrays (Matrices)  
- nD Arrays (Tensors)  

These structures form the backbone of Machine Learning and AI systems.

### 2. High Performance

Operations on NumPy arrays are significantly faster than Python lists due to:

- Vectorization  
- Optimized C backend  
- Reduced memory overhead  

---

### 3. Mathematical Operations

NumPy supports:

- Mean, Median, Standard Deviation  
- Element-wise operations  
- Broadcasting  
- Aggregations (sum, min, max, etc.)

---

### 4. Matrix & Linear Algebra Operations

Extremely important for:

- Machine Learning  
- Deep Learning  
- Optimization Algorithms  

Includes:

- Dot product  
- Matrix multiplication  
- Matrix inverse  
- Determinant  
- Eigenvalues

## NumPy is the Foundation For

- Data Analysis (Pandas)  
- Machine Learning  
- Data Science  
- Deep Learning  
- Linear Algebra  
- Computer Vision
